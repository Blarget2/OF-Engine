OctaForge
================

This is OctaForge developer alpha 9 (0.1.8, 26 August 2011)

In sync with Cube 2 / Sauerbraten revision: 3575

For installation, read INSTALL.
To run it, launch run_client.sh on *nix
and run_client.bat on Windows.
run_client.command wraps execution
from Finder on Mac OS X.

There is "empty" map bundled with the engine.
It uses drawing application example by default.
Draw a line with LMB, stop it with RMB, change color
with MMB.

There are other example scripts too.
To use them, simply modify map.lua of "empty" map.

In case of problems, delete contents of your OF home
directory ($HOME/.octaforge_client on *nix,
My Documents\My Games\OctaForge on Windows)

If the problem persists, report it into our
issue tracker - https://github.com/OctaForge/OF-Engine/issues
