OctaForge
================

This is OctaForge developer alpha 3 (0.1.2, 8 May 2011)

In sync with Cube 2 / Sauerbraten revision: 3575

For installation, read INSTALL.
To run it, launch run_client.sh on *nix
and run_client.bat on Windows.
run_client.command wraps execution
from Finder on Mac OS X.

Windows support highly experimental (might not work)

There is generic_dev map bundled with the engine.
Its default map script is simple drawing application.
Draw a line with LMB, stop it with RMB, change color
with MMB.

There are other example scripts for generic_dev too.
To use them, look in data/library/10/mapscripts
and change generic_dev's map.lua accordingly.
