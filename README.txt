OctaForge
================

This is OctaForge developer alpha (0.1.0, 24 April 2011)

For installation, read INSTALL.
To run it, run intensity_client.sh on *nix
and intensity_client.bat on Windows.
intensity_client.command wraps execution
from Finder on Mac OS X.

Under Windows, you need Python 2.6.X installed under
SYSTEMROOT\Python26. If you have different version
of Python or different install path, modify
intensity_client.bat and intensity_server.bat accordingly
(modify PYVER variable so it points to the right path).

You'll also need to install Lua under windows. Get installer
from here: http://code.google.com/p/luaforwindows/
