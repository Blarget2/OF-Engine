OFTL - OctaForge Template Library

Version 0.5.0 (20111112)

is a set of various generic features for the C++ programming language,
simillar in function to the C++ standard library, but with simpler,
more transparent implementation, designed to work well with the
"C with classes" style of writing with usage of the C standard
library.

The API is designed from ground up and NOT compatible with the C++
standard library, albeit freely inspired.

It's released under MIT license and created for needs of the OctaForge
project (http://octaforge.org), however is not limited to it and is
meant to be independent.
